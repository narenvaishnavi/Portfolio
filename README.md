# AgileTimes

Welcome to the Sample app for my Pluralsight Course [Building Beautiful Angular Apps with PrimeNG](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-apps-prime-ng).

The course was officially released on Thursday, Aug 24, 2017.

I'll keep this page updated with breaking changes as the course ages.

## Take it for a spin

I deploy the latest version of the application directly to github pages. 

[Try it out now](https://glenasmith.github.io/pluralsight-primeng/)
 
 
## Starter Kit

Keen to start from scratch? You can (well, almost). There's a [starter-kit](https://github.com/glenasmith/pluralsight-primeng/tree/starter-kit) branch which you can clone/download which contains:
* A basic menu template routing to blank components
* Styling for the shell, but none of the component CSS - which you insert as you go
* Blank component code shells for you to insert code as you follow along 

Remember: we don't cover every bit of CSS styling you need but I do refer when you need to copy and paste. So you might need to switch branches every now and again to grab some CSS styling. 

Go for it!
